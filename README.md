# crostrackpad2-elan
Elan I2C trackpad driver for Acer C720P (Celeron 2957U), Acer C740, Acer C910, Acer CB5-571, Asus C200, Asus C300 and many other chromebooks.

Tested on Acer C720P chromebook with Elan I2C trackpad. Will also work on Acer C740 chromebook out of the box. May need minor adjustments for trackpad size on others; feel free to send a pull request.

Based on cypress crostrackpad2 driver.

Huge thanks to the vmulti and Linux Kernel projects, which I used for references. Also, thanks to Microsoft for open sourcing the Synaptics RMI I2C driver, which I also used as a reference.
